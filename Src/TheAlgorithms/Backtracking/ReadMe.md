## Overview:

* RJ Walkar first describe this algorithm in 1960.
* Letter S. Golamb and L. Baumert develop it.
* It is nothing but modified process of the bruth force approach that systamitacally search for a solution 
  of among all available options.
* Many puzzles can solve with this technique.
* In problem domain it might be many solutions but it just select one solution.
* This procedure is repeat again and again until final stage.
* Polular examples are N-Quen, Sum of subset, Hamiltonion cycle, Sudoku Puzzle.

## Advantages:
* Somecases it is more efficient than dynamic programming.
* It is best for solving techtical problems.
* It is efficient for constraint satisfaction problem.
* Simple to implement
* States are stored in stack. So difference stags the states are usable.

## Disadvanteges:
* Not efficient for solving stratigic problems.
* Normally slow.
* So solve large problems sometimes it takes help from other techniques like Branch and bound.
* Trashing is one of the main problem.
* It detects conflicts too late.

## Applications:
* Robotics
* Artificial Intellegence
* Genetic Algorithm
* Solving puzzles and Path
