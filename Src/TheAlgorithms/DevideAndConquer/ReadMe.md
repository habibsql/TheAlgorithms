## Overview

* Divide the problem into no. of subproblems.
* Conquer(solve) the subproblems.
* Combine the subproblem solutions for geeting the actual solution.
* Often subproblem solutions have done using recursion.

## Flow
* Step-1. Dividing data/input into parts
* Step-2. Finding the sub solution each of the part.
* Step-3. Constructing the final answer from the sub solutions.

## Approach
* Divide problem into smaller subproblems.
	- Subproblems must be same type.
	- Subproblems do not need to overlap.
	- Combine solutions to solve the original problem.

## Examples
* Binary search
* Fibonnacci Sequence
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Matrix multiplication
* Closed Pair
* Multiplying largest Integer.
