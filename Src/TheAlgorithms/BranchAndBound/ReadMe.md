## Overview:

* This method is proposed Alisa Land and Alison Doig in 1960.
* Algorithm design technic used to solve combinatorial optimization problems.
*  combinatorial optimization problems problems are exponential time complexity and need exploring all
   possible permutations. This technique solve that type of problem comparatively faster.
* Its performace depends on efficient estimation of upper and lower bound. It no bounds defined then it search all items.

## Example
* Traveling Sales person problem
* 0/1 KnackSack problem
